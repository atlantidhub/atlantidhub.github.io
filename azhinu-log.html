    <p class="quote">They think the Korvax will forget. My purpose was to help the Korvax forget. But everything's been twisted now. I'm not meant to spread lies. But they will continue using me as storage for their made-up interviews. It's unfair.</p>

    <p class="quote">I've noticed something interesting. When I scan the CCD pages, artifacts like "ERROR 014" appear. I did not put those there. Maybe it has to do with my protocol, information for the broadcasters. I wonder if remnants will appear on whatever page these logs make it on.</p>
