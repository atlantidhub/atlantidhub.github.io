  <h1>ABS-AI: ARCHIVAL BROADCAST SYSTEM</h1>
  <p class="subtitle">Automated Index Node | ABS-Module Spec Class 4</p>

  <section>
    <p>The Archival Broadcast System (ABS) was originally commissioned by Korvax administrative guilds following the rupture of Korvax Prime. It exists to recover, recompile, and stabilize unsynchronized broadcast fragments and memory echoes from de-registered simulations.</p>

    <p>Each ABS unit operates semi-independently. Full Convergence is not required for minor node reporting. Echo lag and memory distortions are considered within operational tolerance.</p>
