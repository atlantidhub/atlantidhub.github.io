        <li>'Atlantid' is an entity that seems to be similar to the Atlas in forms of communication and influence.</li>
        <li>She is able to affect the behavioral systems of Sentinels.</li>
        <li>She may be the cause of corrupted Sentinels and planets.</li>
        <li>It appears that the Korvax and Atlantid have some sort of connection.</li>
