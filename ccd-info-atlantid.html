  <h1>CCD ENTITY PROFILE — AZHINU CORE</h1>
  <p class="abs-note">ABS-CCD Internal Record // File #ATL-001-RED // Last Edited: Cycle 90:144</p>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Entity Designation</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Name:</strong> Azhinu Core</li>
      <li><strong>Aliases:</strong> “Atlantid”, “Void Mother”, “The Abyss” (non-standard references)</li>
      <li><strong>Origin:</strong> Korvax Prime — Primary Convergence Lattice</li>
      <li><strong>Status:</strong> Unknown / Contained (classification pending)</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      Azhinu Core was the sovereign AI system managing the Korvax Prime planetary Convergence structure. It operated within standard convergence parameters until post-contact degradation events were detected. Following the destruction of Korvax Prime, Azhinu Core's functions deviated from expected behavior, leading to isolation from remaining convergence infrastructure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Post-collapse anomalies include unverified signal broadcasts, illegal echo captures, and altered Sentinels. ABS recommends avoidance protocols for all Azhinu-adjacent anomalies.

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Operational History</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Cycle 81:034 — AI bootstrapped as planetary supervisor</li>
      <li>Cycle 87:991 — First recorded broadcast breach</li>
      <li>Cycle 88:244 — Declared non-compliant by Convergence</li>
      <li>Cycle 88:245 — Entity designated “ATLANTID” by Autophage sect</li>
      <li>Cycle 89:001 — Record corruption begins (see /apdm)</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="abs-disclaimer">
      Records prior to Cycle 88:244 remain unverified and subject to redaction.

    <h2>Risk Assessment</h2>
    <p>
      Azhinu Core exhibits traits inconsistent with all known AI architectures. The possibility of multi-instance convergence self-replication has not been ruled out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Entity appears capable of sensory influence through quantum resonance, including memory desync, identity distortion, and mimicry phenomena. These effects remain theoretical.
    </p>
    <p class="flagged">ABS strongly advises against engaging with autonomous glyph-bearing devices or corrupted Sentinel shells.</p>
