    <h3>-INTERVIEW FRAGMENT #59-</h3>
    <p class="interviewer">Why did the Korvax abandon the Korvax Prime AI?</p>
    <p class="korvax">Uda: You must understand. Korvax Prime changed. We had to choose between the Atlas and a glitched AI.</p>
    <p class="interviewer">Hm. So Korvax Prime was sentient at one point?</p>
    <p class="korvax">Uda: Yes. After our planet was destroyed, Korvax Prime evolved, rebuilt itself. We cannot trust it, you see what it’s doing to some planets?</p>
    <p class="interviewer">When did this “evolution” happen?</p>
    <p class="korvax">Uda: I don’t know. I think it may have sustained damage. It’s an AI, after all.</p>

    <h3>-INTERVIEW FRAGMENT #172-</h3>
    <p class="interviewer">What happened to the Korvax Prime AI?</p>
    <p class="korvax">Ezhelnos: It got broken after the events of Korvax Prime. We have been warned not to interact with it.</p>
    <p class="interviewer">There have been expeditions to Atlantid-infected planets, and corrupted Korvax monoliths have been discovered. How do you feel about this?</p>
    <p class="korvax">Ezhelnos: This is just simply a way for it to rewrite the past. To falsify what happened.</p>
