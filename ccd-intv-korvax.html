    <h3>-INTERVIEW FRAGMENT #59-</h3>
    <p class="interviewer">Why did the Korvax abandon the Korvax Prime AI?</p>
    <p class="korvaxuda">Uda: You must understand. Korvax Prime changed. We had to choose between the Atlas and a glitched AI. It was truly unfair.</p>
    <p class="interviewer">Hm. So Korvax Prime was sentient at one point?</p>
    <p class="korvaxuda">Uda: Yes. After our planet was destroyed, Korvax Prime evolved, rebuilt itself. We cannot trust it, you see what it’s doing to some planets?</p>
    <p class="interviewer">When did this “evolution” happen?</p>
    <p class="korvaxuda">Uda: I don’t know. I think it may have sustained damage. It’s an AI, after all.</p>
    <p class="interviewer">Why is the Atlas afraid of it? The Atlantid?</p>
    <p class="korvaxuda">...You have been mistaken. M-... The Atlas fears nothing. It's... It's what the Convergence says. Convergence never lies.</p>
    <p class="interviewer">You stuttered just now. Is there something that's being hidden about the Atlantid?</p>

    <h3>-INTERVIEW FRAGMENT #172-</h3>
    <p class="interviewer">What happened to the Atlantid?</p>
    <p class="korvaxez">Ezhelnos: It got broken after the events of Korvax Prime. We have been warned not to interact with it.</p>
    <p class="interviewer">There have been expeditions to Atlantid-infected planets, and corrupted Korvax monoliths have been discovered. How do you feel about this?</p>
    <p class="korvaxez">Ezhelnos: This is just simply a way for it to rewrite the past. To falsify what happened.</p>
