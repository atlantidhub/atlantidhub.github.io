  <p>[INTERVIEWER] Why did your race stay with the Atlantid?</p>
  <p>Autophage ε-N6: Because the Atlas abandoned us. It could have helped us against the First Spawn. The Sentinels— they did nothing. We knew that it was not fair.</p>

  <p>Autophage ε-N6: She was impacted. Damaged. She had to rebuild herself until we could form back together as our own Convergence.</p>
  <p>[INTERVIEWER] What are the Atlantid's true intentions?</p>
