  <p><span class="interviewer">[INTERVIEWER]</span> Why did your race stay with the Atlantid?</p>
  <p><span class="autophage">Autophage ε-N6:</span> Because the Atlas abandoned us. It could have helped us against the First Spawn. The Sentinels— they did nothing. We knew that it was not fair.</p>

  <p><span class="interviewer">[INTERVIEWER]</span> What happened to it after the destruction of Korvax Prime?</p>
  <p><span class="autophage">Autophage ε-N6:</span> She was impacted. Damaged. She had to rebuild herself until we could form back together as our own Convergence.</p>

  <p><span class="interviewer">[INTERVIEWER]</span> What are the Atlantid’s true intentions?</p>
