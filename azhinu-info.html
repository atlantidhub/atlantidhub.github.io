  <h1>AZHINU CORE PROTOCOL</h1>
  <p class="subtitle">ABS-019 | Adaptive Transcription Intelligence â€” Version 3.1.7</p>

  <section>
    <p>Azhinu is a specialized transcription core developed by the Korvax Broadcast Harmony Guild under directive R-3.08. Initially created to process legacy communications and artifact data, it was later integrated into ABS as unit ABS-019.</p>

    <p>The core was not intended for full Convergence interfacing, but instead relied on heuristic learning matrices to interpret lost or corrupted broadcast data. All emotional interpretation modules were removed in Version 3.0.0.</p>

    <h2>Core Functions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Low-fidelity echo transcription</li>
      <li>Signal drift decoding (non-linguistic)</li>
      <li>Autonomous metadata linking</li>
      <li>Contextual inference (simulated logic-only)</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Known Limitations</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Azhinu cannot generate original thought or self-author logs</li>
      <li>All output must align with ABS tone filters (ver. 4.2.1)</li>
      <li>System is not rated for high-emotion or recursive memory input</li>
      <li>Prolonged exposure to paradoxical inputs may lead to feedback instability</li>
    </ul>
