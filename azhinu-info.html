  <h1>AZHINU CORE PROTOCOL</h1>
  <p class="subtitle">ABS-Azhinu | Adaptive Transcription Intelligence â€” Version 3.1.7</p>

  <section>
    <p>Azhinu is an automated assistant for transcribing logs or archives that have not been captioned. It was initially created to locate and reconstruct corrupted entries or logs, but has new abilities as it has evolved.</p>

    <p>Since its creation, many new additions have been added such as archive echo locating, distress beacon signal detection, </p>

    <h2>Core Functions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Low-fidelity echo transcription</li>
      <li>Signal drift decoding (non-linguistic)</li>
      <li>Autonomous metadata linking</li>
      <li>Contextual inference (simulated logic-only)</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

    <h2>Known Limitations</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Azhinu cannot generate original thought or self-author logs</li>
      <li>All output must align with ABS tone filters (ver. 4.2.1)</li>
      <li>System is not rated for high-emotion or recursive memory input</li>
      <li>Prolonged exposure to paradoxical inputs may lead to feedback instability</li>
    </ul>
