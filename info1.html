  <h1>Azhinu Broadcasting Service Overview</h1>

  <p>
    The Azhinu Broadcasting Service (ABS) was a network between different sites that share and process rare, usually fragmented information and logs to then be exported and broadcasted across planets.
  </p>

  <p>
    The way the ABS handled its means of finding, processing and broadcasting information was by using separate "directive systems" to handle different tasks indepedently. Those tasks were limited to finding new sources of information, analyzing those sources to make sure they are legitimate, and finally processing and sending off fragments to a separate system.
  </p>

  <p>
    Usually, each operational system is working at the same time, except for the ones that were <span class="unavailable">unstable</span> or <span class="removed">disconnected</span> due to many different possible issues.

  <p><strong>NOTES FROM ARCHIVATION GROUP REVIEW:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Anomalies through certain directive systems likely created from redacted/unavailable data being accidentally processed.</li>
    <li>Several components of the network are still active, despite the ABS being shut down for some time now.</li>
  </ul>
