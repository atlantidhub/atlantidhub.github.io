  <h1>Azhinu Broadcasting Service Overview</h1>
  <p class="subtitle">
    Compiled by the Korvax Archivation Group under limited access protocol.  
    Source reliability estimated at 73%.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Azhinu Broadcasting Service (ABS) was a network between different sites that share and process rare, usually fragmented information and logs to then be exported and broadcasted across planets.
  </p>

  <p>
    The way the ABS handled its means of finding, processing and broadcasting information was by using separate "directive systems" to handle different tasks indepedently. Those tasks were limited to finding new sources of information, analyzing those sources to make sure they are legitimate, and finally processing and sending off fragments to a separate system.
  </p>

  <p>
    Usually, each operational system is working at the same time, except for the ones that were <span class="unavailable">unstable</span> or <span class="removed">disconnected</span> due to many different possible issues.

  <p><strong>NOTES FROM ARCHIVATION GROUP REVIEW:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>After some lost ABS informational files were imported from archive banks</li>
    <li>Anomalies through certain directive systems likely created from redacted/unavailable data being accidentally processed.</li>
    <li>Several components of the network are still active, despite the ABS being shut down for some time now.</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="note">Further documentation may be found in directive capture logs and node status reports.</p>
